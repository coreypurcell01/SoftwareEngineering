Using a source code control system is helpful to manage development because it allows multiple people to work on the same thing and also allows a team or group of people to distribute a project and assign different parts to a specific individual.

"Issues" are used track todos, bugs, feature requests, and more.
"Pull requests" are used to help you collaborate on code with other people.

-The distinctions between issues and pull requests are that issues are more of an agenda where you can keep everyone up to date and track when you need to get things done where pull requests are directed more towards getting code so you can test, modiy, run etc..
